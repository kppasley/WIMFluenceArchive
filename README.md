# WIMFluence Archive
This repository is an archive for the WIMFluence project and scripts developed for the Arkansas Department of Transportation project TRC1701, "Bridge Load Posting Based on Actual Arkansas Truck Traffic."  This is intended to preserve the functionality as it existed at the completion of TRC1701.

For an updated version of WIMFluence, see https://github.com/kppasley/WIMFluence.  However, future versions of WIMFluence found there are not guaranteed to function the same as this version.
